## to run

The idea is that you just let it record while you do your work, and when you encounter a bug or something you want to save, then you save it.

Instructions: Just click "Record" and pick a screen. Do your work. When you've captured something worth saving, press "Pause" and then "Save".

NOTE: Once or twice (but I don't know how to reproduce), I've seen the app fill up the browser memory and crash. 
Let me know if this happens to you, or if you have ideas how to fix it.
